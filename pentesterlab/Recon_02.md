# PentesterLab - Recon 02

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to retrieve the `security.txt` file from the
hackycorp.com website.

Grade: Easy

## Initial Analysis

Given that the objective is to retrieve a file from a web server, one common
approach is to use a web browser. The `security.txt` file is traditionally
stored in the root directory of a website, so the URL to use is
https://hackycorp.com/security.txt.

This produces a `404`, so the file doesn't exist. This means it's probably in
another location: https://hackycorp.com/.well-known/security.txt

Once you retrieve this file, you'll find a message at the bottom indicating that
the challenge is solved, with the last line containing a key in the form of a
_UUID_.

## Key Takeaways

This challenge introduces the concept of the `security.txt` file. This file is
used to tell people how to report security vulnerabilities to the website
owners. This file is important to know how to responsible disclose
vulnerabilities, but doesn't really play a role in finding vulnerabilities in a
website.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

While a web browser is the simplest way to retrieve the `security.txt` file,
there are other methods you can use, such as the `curl` command-line tool.

### Using curl

The `curl` tool is a versatile command-line utility for transferring data from
or to a server. This method is particularly useful if you need to automate the
process or retrieve multiple files at once.

Here's how you can retrieve the `security.txt` file with `curl`:

```sh
$ curl https://hackycorp.com/.well-known/security.txt
# Please don't report any security issue for this site
# This is a recon challenge and the key for this exercise is
# 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

> Note: the real challenge key has been replaced with a fake _UUID_.
