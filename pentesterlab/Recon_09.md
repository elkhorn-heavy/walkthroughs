# PentesterLab - Recon 09

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to gain information about the server from the
response headers.

Grade: Easy

## Initial Analysis

This challenge actually doesn't mention which website we should be looking at,
but it is assumed that we're still using hackycorp.com.This challenge was
accidentally solved when looking at [Recon_01.md](Recon_01.md) and the key is
found in the HTTP response headers:

```sh
$ curl -i -v -s hackycorp.com > /dev/null
* Host hackycorp.com:80 was resolved.
* IPv6: (none)
* IPv4: 51.158.147.132
*   Trying 51.158.147.132:80...
* Connected to hackycorp.com (51.158.147.132) port 80
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: hackycorp.com
> User-Agent: curl/8.9.1
> Accept: */*
>
* Request completely sent off
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Server: nginx
< Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 23:03:17 GMT
< Content-Type: text/html
< Content-Length: 16011
< Last-Modified: Tue, 31 Mar 2020 03:12:16 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< ETag: "5e82b510-3e8b"
< pentesterlab_recon_09: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
< Accept-Ranges: bytes
<
{ [14185 bytes data]
* Connection #0 to host hackycorp.com left intact
```

and we can see that the response contains a header called
`pentesterlab_recon_09`, and the value of the header is the key.

## Takeaways

This challenge demonstrates that HTTP responses can contain headers that have
interesting information.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

You could also look at the headers in the devtools section of a browser.
