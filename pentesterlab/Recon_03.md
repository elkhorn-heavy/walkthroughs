# PentesterLab - Recon 03

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is search the hackycorp.com website for a directory
that allows the listing of its contents.

> Note: The description specifically mentions the "main website" so we can
> anything on other servers, such as //assets.hackycorp.com (see below).

Grade: Easy

## Initial Analysis

We can start with the website's main page and look for directories that we can
then try.

1. Visit https://hackycorp.com with a web browser
1. View the page source for the web page
1. Ignore anything from other sites, like //assets.hackycorp.com
1. On line 44 we see an image included from /images
1. Enter https://hackycorp.com/images/ into the browser
1. Hooray! We get a directory listing that includes a `key.txt` file

## Takeaways

This challenge introduces the concept of directory listings for websites. This
is typically a misconfiguration with the website but it does happen and can
provide a wealth of information.
