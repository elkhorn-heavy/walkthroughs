# PentesterLab - Recon 01

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to produce an HTTP `404` page for the
hackycorp.com website.

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

Given that the objective is to get an error page from a web server, one common
approach is to use a web browser. We can try any URL that is unlikely to exist
and hopefully the `404` ("Not Found") response will be returned.

Trying the URL https://hackycorp.com/xxxyyyzzz.html produces the expected `404`
page with the title `404 page! You solved recon_01`. In the body of the page is
the challenge key in the form of a _UUID_.

## Key Takeaways

This challenge introduces the concept of the `404` page that is displayed when
a file does not exist on a website. This is something important to know, as we
might be poking around a site looking for obvious URLs (like `/admin`) and we
need to know what it looks like when we're not successful.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

While a web browser is the simplest way to retrieve a file, there are other
methods you can use, such as the `curl` command-line tool.

### Using curl

The `curl` tool is a versatile command-line utility for transferring data from
or to a server. This method is particularly useful if you need to automate the
process or retrieve multiple files at once.

If we retrieve the file with `curl`:

```sh
$ curl https://hackycorp.com/xxxyyyzzzz.html
<h1>404 page! You solved recon_01</h1>

The key for this challenge is: 00000000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

This only displays the HTML content for the page. Although it says it's a 404
page, it would be more thorough to check the HTTP response code.

`curl` has a `-i` flag to show all the web server response headers. We'll pair
it with the `-s` flag to be _silent_ and not display progress indicators:

```sh
$ curl -i -s https://hackycorp.com/xxxyyyzzzz.html
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Server: nginx
Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 02:13:49 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 108
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "5ed45a11-6c"

<h1>404 page! You solved recon_01</h1>

The key for this challenge is: 00000000-0000-0000-000000000000
