# PentesterLab - Recon 13

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to find the TXT record for the domain name
`key.z.hackycorp.com`.

Grade: Easy

## Initial Analysis

This seems like it'll be fairly straight-forward. Trying `dig`:

```
$ dig key.z.hackycorp.com txt

; <<>> DiG 9.20.0-2ubuntu3.1-Ubuntu <<>> key.z.hackycorp.com txt
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 11893
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 65494
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;key.z.hackycorp.com.           IN      TXT

;; ANSWER SECTION:
key.z.hackycorp.com.    7171    IN      TXT     "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

;; Query time: 0 msec
;; SERVER: 127.0.0.53#53(127.0.0.53) (UDP)
;; WHEN: Tue Mar 18 09:51:22 PDT 2025
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 97
```

We can see the key in the _ANSWER SECTION_.

## Takeaways

This challenge demonstrates the TXT record in DNS. In theory this information
could be useful when exploring servers.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

Using `dig` is one way to retrieve DNS information. The command `nslookup` can
also be used:

```
$ nslookup -q=txt key.z.hackycorp.com
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
key.z.hackycorp.com     text = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
