# PentesterLab - Recon 23

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge the goal is to look at the `repo0a` repository to find the key
in the commit messages.

Grade: Easy

## Initial Analysis

This carries on from the previous challenges. The `repo0a` repository has 103
commits, and at first glance all of them appear to have the same commit message.
However, one of them has a multi-line message, which is displayed in the GitHub
web UI with an ellipsis. Clicking the ellipsis shows the key.

## Takeaways

This challenge shows that commit messages can span multiple lines. This means
that a wealth of information can be stored in these messages.
