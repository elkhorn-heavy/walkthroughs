# PentesterLab - Recon 06

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to use the `Host` request header to get the
default host for a web server.

Grade: Easy

## Initial Analysis

We're given a hint to use `curl` to call the web server and to use the `Host`
header.

```
$ curl -H "Host: something.else.com" hackycorp.com
<h1>Well done! You solved recon_06 </h1>

The key for this exercise is 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

> Note: the real challenge key has been replaced with a fake _UUID_.

## Takeaways

This challenge introduces the idea of virtual hosts. A web server can respond to
different domain names with different content, even though the server is the
same machine. It "virtually" hosts multiple sites. This is done by looking at
the `Host` header in the HTTP request, and then serving the content for that
website.

The default website is served when an unknown domain is requested. This can be
turned off in the web server configuration, but this step may be forgotten. It
might be possible to get information from the default host.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

While `curl` is a tool commonly used to manipulate request headers, it can also
be done in the browser developer tools. For example, Firefox allows the editing
and re-sending of requests.
