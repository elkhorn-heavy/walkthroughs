# PentesterLab - Recon 22

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge the goal is to look at the `repo9` repository to find deleted
files.

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

This carries on from the previous challenges. The `repo9` repository has 116
commits, and all of them have the same message. Looking at them one-by-one in
the GitHub web UI is too tedious.

The first step is to `git clone` the repository. Running `git log` tells us
nothing. This is where you're supposed to pull out your `git` skills and find
the commits with deleted files.

However.

After opening the repository in `VSCode`, the activity bar on the left contains
the item for `Source Control`. When this is opened, the commits can be scrolled
through, showing the diff for each commit. Eventually there is a commit where
a `KEY.txt` file was deleted.

## Takeaways

This challenge shows something really important - confidential information
committed to a repository never goes away. It can be removed, but it will still
be in the history. Any time that confidential information like a key or password
is committed, it must be changed and then removed from the repository.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

The above shows something interesting: the fastest way to solve a challenge
depends on one's _current_ knowledge. In this case, scrolling through the VSCode
diffs was faster than figuring out the `git` command, if any, that find what is
needed.

This challenge teaches that knowledge was lacking for how to use `git`. This is
an opportunity to put something on the "to learn for next time" list.
