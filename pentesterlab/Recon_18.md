# PentesterLab - Recon 16

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge the goal is to look at the public repository of the
developers for Hacky Corp.

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

This carries on from the previous challenge. By going to github.com/hackycorp
we can then go to the `People` tab. This shows us the `hackycorpdev` user, and
this user also has a repository called `test1`. If we then look at the one
commit we see that the `TEST` file was added, and it contains the key.

## Takeaways

One thing this challenge introduces is the idea that secret information can
accidentally be committed to repositories.
