# PentesterLab - Recon 19

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge the goal is to look at the `repo7` repository. The commits
are supposed to contain email addresses of interest.

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

This carries on from the previous challenges. It wasn't obvious how to find the
email addresses through the GitHub web UI. So the next tactic is to clone the
repository. After doing so, the `git log` command shows that one of the commits
has an email address containing the key.

## Takeaways

This challenge shows us that we are able to find email addresses of committers
to repositories, even if that information is not available through the GitHub
web UI.
