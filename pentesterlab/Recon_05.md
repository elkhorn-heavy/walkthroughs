# PentesterLab - Recon 05

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to use "fuzzing" tools to automatically search
for "hidden" directories on websites. The example tools given are:

- patator
- FFUF
- WFuzz

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

This challenge actually doesn't mention which website we should be looking at,
but it is assumed that we're still using hackycorp.com. We're given a hint that
a fuzzing tool would be good.

Since the idea is to find hidden directories, I chose
[dirb](https://dirb.sourceforge.net/) to do the scan. The main part of the
scan looks like:

```sh
---- Scanning URL: https://hackycorp.com/ ----
==> DIRECTORY: https://hackycorp.com/admin/
==> DIRECTORY: https://hackycorp.com/images/
+ https://hackycorp.com/index.html (CODE:200|SIZE:16011)
+ https://hackycorp.com/robots.txt (CODE:200|SIZE:121)
==> DIRECTORY: https://hackycorp.com/startpage/
```

So this is interesting as we haven't seen `/startpage` before:

```sh
$ curl https://hackycorp.com/startpage/
<h1>It works! You solved recon_05</h1>

The key for this exercise is: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

> Note: the real challenge key has been replaced with a fake _UUID_.

## Takeaways

This challenge introduces the use of fuzzers to search websites for hidden
directories and files. These areas are called hidden because they are not
necessarily accessible by following links from the main page. In
most cases these hidden directories will be protected from being viewed, but
mistakes and misconfigurations happen.

Although some tools can be a bit "script kiddie", these fuzzing and brute force
tools are important to know.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

This exploit used the tool `dirb` because it specifically searches for
directories and files. However, it works by checking items taken from a
dictionary of common names and different dictionaries may produce different
results. It's good to be familiar with a wide selection of tools since one may
succeed where others fail.
