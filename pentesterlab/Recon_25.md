# PentesterLab - Recon 25

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge the goal is to find a file named `key2.txt` on the server that
provides the website assets. The hint here is that the file is in S3 storage but
is allowed to "Any users".

Grade: Easy

## Initial Analysis

Checking https://assets.hackycorp.com/key2.txt gives an access denied message.
This is where the hint comes into play: you need an AWS account to fetch the
key using the `awscli` tool.

## Takeaways

This challenge shows that misconfigured S3 buckets contain all sorts of
interesting things.
