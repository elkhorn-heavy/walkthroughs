# PentesterLab - Recon 24

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the focus moves away from GitHub. The challenge here is to
find a file named `key.txt` on the server that provides the web site assets.

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

The assets server was noticed in previous challenges, and now it is a challenge
itself. This server provides the static files (css, js) that are used by the
main website.

By scrolling through the page source for hackycorp.com, we see that assets
server is called assets.hackycorp.com. It's tempting to overthink this challenge
and enumerate all the directories we can find in the page source for
hackycorp.com.

However, this challenge is not that difficult: the file we're looking for is at
the root, in https://assets.hackycorp.com/key.txt.

## Takeaways

This challenge shows that for performance and/or security reasons, the static
files for a website might be provided by a separate server. Reading the page
source for a web site can provide the first step in finding other servers to
look at.
