# PentesterLab - Recon 26

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge the goal is to find a hardcoded key in one of the asset files.

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

This is easy because there are a limited amount of files loaded from the assets
server. Additionally this key was accidentally discovered in a previous
challenge, so there isn't much to do.

After going to https://hackycorp.com, view the source for the web page. You can
click each of the assets and scan / search for something like "recon". Near the
bottom of the source is `script.js`, which includes:

```
ptlab_key_recon_26: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
```

> Note: the real challenge key has been replaced with a fake _UUID_.

## Takeaways

This challenge shows that there is plenty to be found in the static files for a
website. Developers may "temporarily" put credentials into files when they are
doing development, but forget to remove them.
