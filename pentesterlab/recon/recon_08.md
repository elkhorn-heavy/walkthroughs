# PentesterLab - Recon 08

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to gain information about the server from the
TLS certifcate.

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

We're given a hint to use a client or OpenSSL. The client / browser is an easy
option.

Opening https://hackycorp.com in a browser, we can examine the server TLS
certificate for the website. In the information is a section called `Subject
Alt Names`, and within those names is
https://66177e3f25e3ea0713807b1dc5f0b9df.hackycorp.com, which looks strange. By
visiting that site we get the page:

```
Well done! You solved recon_08

The key for this exercise is: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

> Note: the real challenge key has been replaced with a fake _UUID_.

## Takeaways

This challenge demonstrates that the server TLS certificate for one website can
be used to find other websites. The websites typically resolve to the same host
but in this case we have found some additional information.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

As mentioned in the description of the challenge, the client used could also be
`openssl`.

```
$ openssl s_client -connect hackycorp.com:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null | \
    openssl x509 -inform pem -text | \
    grep -A1 "Subject Alternative Name"
            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
                DNS:66177e3f25e3ea0713807b1dc5f0b9df.hackycorp.com, DNS:hackycorp.com, DNS:www.hackycorp.com
$ curl https://66177e3f25e3ea0713807b1dc5f0b9df.hackycorp.com
<h1>Well done! You solved   recon_08</h1>

The key for this exercise is: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
