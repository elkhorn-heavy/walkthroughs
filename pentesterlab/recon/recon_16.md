# PentesterLab - Recon 16

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to retrieve the version of `bind` used by
`z.hackycorp.com`.

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

This seems like it'll be fairly straight-forward. Trying `dig`:

```
$ dig chaos txt version.bind @z.hackycorp.com

; <<>> DiG 9.20.0-2ubuntu3.1-Ubuntu <<>> chaos txt version.bind @z.hackycorp.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 20845
;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1
;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;version.bind.                  CH      TXT

;; ANSWER SECTION:
version.bind.           0       CH      TXT     "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
version.bind.           0       CH      NS      version.bind.

;; Query time: 296 msec

## Takeaways

This challenge demonstrates that DNS has a class of information called `CHAOS`.
These records can be used to find additional information, such as the version of
`bind`. This normally isn't possible, as the `bind` server should be configured
to not provide this information.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

Using `dig` is one way to retrieve DNS information. The command `nslookup` can
also be used:

```
$ nslookup -q=txt -class=CHAOS version.bind z.hackycorp.com
Server:         z.hackycorp.com
Address:        51.158.147.132#53

version.bind    text = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```
