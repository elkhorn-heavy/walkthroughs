# PentesterLab - Recon 20

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge the goal is to look at the `repo3` repository. This time the
focus is on the branches.

Grade: Easy

## Initial Analysis

This carries on from the previous challenges. The `repo3` repository has two
branches, and the name of the second branch is the key.

## Takeaways

This challenge shows us that the main branch isn't the only source of
information. New branches might contain information that shouldn't have been
committed, and haven't been reviewed and sanitized yet.
