# PentesterLab - Recon 07

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to use the `Host` request header to get the
default TLS host for a web server. The difference between this challenge and the
previous one is that now we're looking for the default _TLS_ host.

Grade: Easy

## Initial Analysis

This challenge actually doesn't mention which website we should be looking at,
but it is assumed that we're still using hackycorp.com. We're given a hint to
use `curl` to call the web server and to use the `Host` header.

```sh
$ curl -H "Host: something.else.com" https://hackycorp.com
<h1>Well done! You solved recon_07</h1>

The key for this exercise is 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

> Note: the real challenge key has been replaced with a fake _UUID_.

## Takeaways

This challenge works on the virtual hosts concept introduced in the previous
challenge. The difference here is that we're accessing the default _TLS_ host,
which could possibly expose different information that the non-TLS host. It is
a good idea to check both.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

Similar to the previous exercise, instead of using `curl` something like the
browser developer tools could be used. For example, Firefox allows the editing
and re-sending of requests.
