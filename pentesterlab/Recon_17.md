# PentesterLab - Recon 16

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge there's a change of focus: find who made the commits to
the `test1` repository on GitHub. As a hint the first step is finding the
account for Hacky Corp.

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

Interesting that this is considered to be a medium. A search for
"github hackycorp test1" brings us to the repo. The only commit was by _Hacky
Dev_, and the key is appended to the username. By hovering over the username
you can read the full key.

## Takeaways

This challenge serves as an introduction to GitHub. GitHub is a great place to
find tools and research vulnerabilities.
