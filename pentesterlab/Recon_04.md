# PentesterLab - Recon 04

PentesterLab offers a series of reconnaissance ("recon") challenges designed to
teach basic security skills.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to manually search for common directories on
websites. The example of `/admin/` is given.

Grade: Medium

## Initial Analysis

Given that the objective is to find a "hidden" directory on a web server, one
common approach is to use a web browser. Since the example was `/admin/` then
the first URL to use is https://hackycorp.com/admin/.

As expected, this page says that recon*04 has been solved and it provides the
challenge key in the form of a \_UUID*.

## Takeaways

This challenge introduces the concept of "hidden" directories on websites. Not
all parts of a website are accessible by following links from the main page. In
most cases these hidden directories will be protected from being viewed.
However, when doing reconnaissance of a website it is good to check the obvious
directories to see if any information is available.

## Beyond the Challenge

### Alternative Methods to Solve the Challenge

While a web browser is the simplest way to check if `/admin/` is available,
there are other methods you can use, such as the `curl` command-line tool.

### Using curl

The `curl` tool is a versatile command-line utility for transferring data to or
from a server. This method is particularly useful if you need to automate the
process or retrieve multiple files at once.

Here's how you can retrieve the directory with `curl`:

```
$ curl https://hackycorp.com/admin/

<h1>Well done! You solved recon_04</h1>

The key for this exercise is: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
